## Checklist for API Pentesting

### Use of wildcard parameters
Try to use the following symbols as wildcards: *, %, _, .    

* /api/users/*    
* /api/users/%    
* /api/users/_    
* /api/users/.

Such wildcard usage with the API Endpoints can lead to the backend stack trace being returned in the API Response, and you can obtain quite a good and valuable information from that stack trace such as "which backend server and its version they are using", "internal system paths", "information about the code flow".
